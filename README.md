Microservices Automated Testing Book
*replace microservice with micro-front-end for a comparable architectural overview*
	- instead of distributed, decoupled microservices, CSI or ESI allows for distributed, decoupled micro-frontends (self contained html documents - web components, polymer, react/jsx-style components)
		- multiple developers
		- local scoping - no conflicts between developers / namespace space collisions
	- containerized approach would be best

- Complicated systems create a longer time-to-market

- Following ITIL's strategy -> design -> transition services decrease development time by separating concerns (removing qa, cross-browser, accessibility, code style / machine formatting, regression testing, and code quality / unit testing from the developer's purview via automation ), leaving only development concerns. 

Takeaway 
- nice to have's versus expected deliverables?

Document-driven development approved
